# Java Multithreading Project

This is a Java project demonstrating various multithreading concepts including:

- Basic thread creation (extending Thread class and implementing Runnable)
- Thread pools and ExecutorService
- Synchronization mechanisms
- Producer-Consumer pattern
- Concurrent collections
- Thread safety and race conditions

When working with this codebase:
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Include proper exception handling for threading operations
- Add appropriate comments in German or English
- Use modern Java threading APIs when possible
- Demonstrate thread safety principles
